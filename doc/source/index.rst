The volmdlr library is an open-source Python library primarily developed by Dessia Technologies,
aimed at providing 3D modeling capabilities based on Boundary Representation (B-Rep) purely in Python.
The library is designed to be easy to use, efficient, and customizable.

Boundary Representation is a technique used in computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided
manufacturing (CAM) systems to represent the geometry of a solid object as a collection of surfaces
and curves. B-Rep is widely used in CAD and CAM due to its ability to accurately represent complex
shapes and to provide a rich set of operations for manipulating and analyzing these shapes.

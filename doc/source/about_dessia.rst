About Dessia
============

Objective
---------

Dessia aims to provide a platform that enables engineers to organize and utilize
their expertise through bots. This solution offers significant advantages for
engineers, allowing them to generate a multitude of solutions to facilitate
well-informed decision-making. Our platform provides a low-code Python-based
SDK that empowers method engineers to express the expertise of engineers.
Additionally, we offer a web-based platform that allows users to execute these
bots without needing extensive Python knowledge.

History
-------

In 2017, Steven Masfaraud and Pierre-Emmanuel Dumouchel, two former engineers
from Peugeot-Citroen, founded Dessia. Initially, their goal was to develop a
generic engineering language for gearbox design. Subsequently, they expanded
their vision and developed a generic platform capable of collecting diverse
engineering expertise and implementing it through bots.

Today, Dessia employs 25 people primarily based in Antony,
ÃŽle-de-France. Since 2021, Dessia has been supported by three specialized
software investment funds focused on the engineering domain.

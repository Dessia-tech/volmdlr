Welcome to volmdlr!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The volmdlr library is an open-source Python library primarily developed by Dessia Technologies,
aimed at providing 3D modeling capabilities based on Boundary Representation (B-Rep) purely in Python.
The library is designed to be easy to use, efficient, and customizable.

Boundary Representation is a technique used in computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided
manufacturing (CAM) systems to represent the geometry of a solid object as a collection of surfaces
and curves. B-Rep is widely used in CAD and CAM due to its ability to accurately represent complex
shapes and to provide a rich set of operations for manipulating and analyzing these shapes.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the installation is successful but your IDE don't recognize the package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case you may have several versions of Python installed on your
computer. Make sure the `pip` command points to the right Python version, or
that you have selected the desired Python version in your IDE.
You can force the installation of the package on a given Python version by
executing this command::

  python -m pip install volmdlr

You have to specify the Python version you are working with by replacing
`python` by the Python of your choice. For example, `python3`, `python3.8`,
`python3.9`, etc.
